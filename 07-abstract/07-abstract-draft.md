For my bachelor's work, I chose the topic of creation and design of the printed bilingual publication. 

I chose the work of Hungarian artist [Gyula Ilyés](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyula_Illyés) “One sentence about tyranny”. The book is written in Czech and Hungarian language with additional illustrations of poetic imageries in the text itself. I was closely in contact with the translator and discussed the language side, poetic imageries, and philosophical questions of the work.

In the practical part, I describe the process of creating books and illustrations. Choosing the right type of paper and binding.

Further, I deal with the marketing of the printed publications. (Live reading, types advertising)
