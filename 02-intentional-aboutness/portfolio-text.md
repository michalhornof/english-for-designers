Michal Hornof

Hi,
My name is Michal and I like to look for ways to make things more original and above all tightened to the end.

Right now I study graphic and media design at the university.
I have experience in creating logos, posters, promotional prints and illustrations.
I have already created posters for several rock bands and coffee houses. I have also been involved in creating FF UK event promotional materials.

I really love cooking, painting, meeting with friends along with playing computer games in my free time.
