Michal Hornof

Hi,
My name is Michal and I love everything visual.
I really love to cook, paint, meet with friends and play some old school computer games.

I study graphic design at the university along with starting startup with my friends and creating graphic works for people I met.
I have experience in creating posters, promotional prints, logos and illustrations.
I have already created posters for several rock bands, coffee houses as well as creating Charles University event promotional materials.
